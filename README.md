## 📘 Overview

The **Online Warehouse System** is a **menu-driven console application** that simulates the full operations of a single warehouse — from inventory management and discount rules to customer purchases, shipment tracking, and reporting.  

It was developed as a **group project** for CMPS251 to demonstrate key principles of **object-oriented programming (OOP)**, including abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, while emphasizing good software design and system interaction.

## 🚀 Features

### 👩‍💼 Staff Operations
- **Add Customers:** Register new customers (ID + Name).
- **Manage Discounts:** Create, activate, and deactivate discounts with automatic *overlap enforcement* — when two discounts overlap in date, the newest one remains active.
- **Stock Management:** Add and list books, electronics, and grocery products.
- **Shipment Tracking:** Update shipment statuses (Created → Packed → In Transit → Out for Delivery → Delivered).
- **Reports:** Generate up to 15 different real-time operational reports, including:
  - Active and historical discounts
  - Product stock and valuation
  - Orders by date or customer
  - Shipments by status
  - Total revenue, payment summaries, and discount usage

---

### 🧑‍💻 Customer Operations
- **Login by Customer ID**
- **Browse Inventory:** View available products grouped by category.
- **Shopping Cart:** Add, remove, or review items before checkout.
- **Checkout Process:**
  - Apply active discounts automatically based on date.
  - Calculate shipping costs using a *weight-based rate table*.
  - Accept both **cash** and **card payments**.
- **Order Creation:** Each successful checkout converts the cart into an order and shipment.
- **Inventory Sync:** Stock levels automatically adjust after purchase.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

| Component | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **App** | Launches the system, loads seed data, and displays the main menu. |
| **WarehouseSystem** | Core controller handling customers, products, discounts, orders, and shipments. |
| **StaffMenu / CustomerMenu** | Console interfaces for staff and customer interactions. |
| **Product, BookProduct, ElectronicProduct, GroceryProduct** | Abstract and concrete classes representing product categories. |
| **ShoppingCart / CartItem** | Handle user cart operations and calculations. |
| **Order / OrderItem** | Capture completed purchase data. |
| **Discount, FixedAmountDiscount, PercentageDiscount** | Manage discount logic and overlap rules. |
| **Shipment / ShipmentStatus** | Handle shipment creation and tracking. |
| **Payment, CashPayment, CardPayment** | Represent payment details and types. |
| **ReportService** | Generates all operational summaries for staff. |
| **SeedData** | Populates the system with initial demo data. |

## ⚙️ Shipping Rate Table

| Weight Range (kg) | Shipping Fee (QAR) |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| Up to 2 kg | 10 |
| >2 – 5 kg | 20 |
| >5 – 10 kg | 35 |
| >10 kg | 50 |

---

## 💾 Data Persistence

All system data (customers, products, discounts, orders, and shipments) are stored in **ArrayLists** during runtime.  
Upon program exit, the data is **saved to text files**.  
When the program restarts, it **reloads the data** from those text files automatically.

---

## 📊 Reports Overview

**Reports generated by staff include:**
1. All Discounts  
2. Active Discounts (today)  
3. Products by Category  
4. Low Stock Items  
5. Out of Stock Items  
6. Inventory Valuation  
7. Orders Today  
8. Sales by Customer  
9. Shipments by Status  
10. Pending Shipments (not delivered)  
11. Top-Selling Products  
12. Total Revenue (All Time)  
13. Payments Summary  
14. Discount Usage Summary  
15. Active Discount Overlaps (today)

---

## 🧩 Example Workflow

1. **Staff Menu:** Add customers, create overlapping discounts, add products.  
2. **Customer Menu:** Login → Add items → Checkout → Pay → Shipment created.  
3. **Staff Menu:** Update shipment statuses and generate reports.  
4. **System Exit:** Data saved to text files.

## 🧠 Key Object-Oriented Concepts Used
- **Encapsulation:** Data stored and accessed through getters/setters.
- **Inheritance:** Shared logic in abstract classes (`Product`, `Discount`).
- **Polymorphism:** Common interfaces for `Payment` and discount calculation.
- **Abstraction:** Logical separation between menus, data models, and services.

---

## 🧪 Testing & Demonstration
- Five customer transactions (mixed cash/card).
- Overlapping discount rule tested (new active discounts deactivate old ones).
- Shipment lifecycle updates.
- All reports verified for accurate aggregation.

---

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Group Information
Each group consists of **3–4 members**.  
The submission includes:
- Complete project code (`.zip` or Eclipse export)
- MS Word report with:
  - Cover page (names + QU IDs)
  - Screenshots showing input/output and captions

Each member must also submit a **self-report** describing their individual contribution and reflection on teamwork.

## 🏅 Grading Breakdown

| Component | Weight | Description |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| **Group Work** | 7% | Functionality, code quality, Javadoc, and report |
| **Individual Work** | 12% | Modification task to demonstrate individual understanding |

**Total Project Weight:** 19% of final course grade.  
🚫 *Plagiarism or AI-generated code without permission results in 0% for all members.*

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- **Language:** Java  
- **IDE:** Eclipse  
- **Data Storage:** Plain-text persistence  
- **Concepts Used:** OOP, Collections (ArrayList), Inheritance, Interfaces

---

## 🏁 How to Run
1. Open the project in **Eclipse IDE**.  
2. Run the `App.java` class.  
3. Follow on-screen menus to navigate as **Staff** or **Customer**.
